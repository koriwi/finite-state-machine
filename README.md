# Finite state machine

This is just an experiment to get going in rust and its macros. Hoping for feedback from more experienced rustaceans :)

## Why?

`rust_fsm` checks the validity of a state transition on runtime. I didn't like that. Also I never wrote a macro myself as I'm pretty nooby in rust.

## ToDo

- Improve invalid state logging in verbose
- The renaming of trait fns should result in more elegant/readable names
