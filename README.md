# Finite state machine

This is just an experiment to get going in rust and its macros. Hoping for feedback from more experienced rustaceans :)

## Usage

Oops, no docs yet.
Checkout the examples to see how to use it.
The quote parser is pretty simple and should be easy to understand. But the code is not optimized.
For a more optimized and complex example, check the csv parser.

## Why?

`rust_fsm` checks the validity of a state transition on runtime. I didn't like that. Also I never wrote a macro myself as I'm pretty nooby in rust.
